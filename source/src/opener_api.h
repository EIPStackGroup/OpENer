 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the introduction.
 *
 * @section install_sec Building
 * How to compile, install and run OpENer on a specific platform.
 *
 * @subsection build_req_sec Requirements
 * OpENer has been developed to be highly portable. The default version targets
 * PCs with a POSIX operating system and a BSD-socket network interface. To
 * test this version we recommend a Linux PC or Windows with Cygwin installed.
 *  You will need to have the following installed:
 *   - gcc, make, binutils, etc.
 *
 * for normal building. These should be installed on most Linux installations
 * and are part of the development packages of Cygwin.
 *
 * For the development itself we recommend the use of Eclipse with the CDT
 * plugin. For your convenience OpENer already comes with an Eclipse project
 * file. This allows to just import the OpENer source tree into Eclipse.
 *
 * @subsection compile_pcs_sec Compile for PCs
 *   -# Directly in the shell
 *       -# Go into the bin/pc directory
 *       -# Invoke make
 *       -# For invoking opener type:\n
 *          ./opener ipaddress subnetmask gateway domainname hostaddress
 * macaddress\n
 *          e.g., ./opener 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 test.com
 * testdevice 00 15 C5 BF D0 87
 *   -# Within Eclipse
 *       -# Import the project
 *       -# Go to the bin/pc folder in the make targets view
 *       -# Choose all from the make targets
 *       -# The resulting executable will be in the directory
 *           ./bin/pc
 *       -# The command line parameters can be set in the run configuration
 * dialog of Eclipse

 * @page porting Porting OpENer
 * @section gen_config_section General Stack Configuration
 * The general stack properties have to be defined prior to building your
 * production. This is done by providing a file called opener_user_conf.h. An
 * example file can be found in the src/ports/POSIX or src/ports/WIN32 directory.
 * The documentation of the example file for the necessary configuration options:
 * opener_user_conf.h
 *
 * @copydoc ./ports/POSIX/sample_application/opener_user_conf.h
 *
 * @section startup_sec Startup Sequence
 * During startup of your EtherNet/IP(TM) device the following steps have to be
 * performed:
 *   -# Configure the network properties:\n
 *       With the following functions the network interface of OpENer is
 *       configured:
 *        - EIP_STATUS ConfigureNetworkInterface(const char *ip_address,
 *        const char *subnet_mask, const char *gateway_address)
 *        - void ConfigureMACAddress(const EIP_UINT8 *mac_address)
 *        - void ConfigureDomainName(const char *domain_name)
 *        - void ConfigureHostName(const char *host_name)
 *        .
 *       Depending on your platform these data can come from a configuration
 *       file or from operating system functions. If these values should be
 *       setable remotely via explicit messages the SetAttributeSingle functions
 *       of the EtherNetLink and the TCPIPInterface object have to be adapted.
 *   -# Set the device's serial number\n
 *      According to the CIP specification a device vendor has to ensure that
 *      each of its devices has a unique 32Bit device id. You can set it with
 *      the function:
 *       - void setDeviceSerialNumber(EIP_UINT32 serial_number)
 *   -# Initialize OpENer: \n
 *      With the function CipStackInit(EIP_UINT16 unique_connection_id) the
 *      internal data structures of opener are correctly setup. After this
 *      step own CIP objects and Assembly objects instances may be created. For
 *      your convenience we provide the call-back function
 *      ApplicationInitialization. This call back function is called when the
 * stack is ready to receive application specific CIP objects.
 *   -# Create Application Specific CIP Objects:\n
 *      Within the call-back function ApplicationInitialization(void) or
 *      after CipStackInit(void) has finished you may create and configure any
 *      CIP object or Assembly object instances. See the module @ref CIP_API
 *      for available functions. Currently no functions are available to
 *      remove any created objects or instances. This is planned
 *      for future versions.
 *   -# Setup the listening TCP and UDP port:\n
 *      THE ETHERNET/IP SPECIFICATION demands from devices to listen to TCP
 *      connections and UDP datagrams on the port AF12hex for explicit messages.
 *      Therefore before going into normal operation you need to configure your
 *      network library so that TCP and UDP messages on this port will be
 *      received and can be hand over to the Ethernet encapsulation layer.
 *
 * @section normal_op_sec Normal Operation
 * During normal operation the following tasks have to be done by the platform
 * specific code:
 *   - Establish connections requested on TCP port AF12hex
 *   - Receive explicit message data on connected TCP sockets and the UPD socket
 *     for port AF12hex. The received data has to be hand over to Ethernet
 *     encapsulation layer with the functions: \n
 *      int HandleReceivedExplictTCPData(socket_platform_t socket_handle, EIP_UINT8* buffer, int
 * buffer_length, int *number_of_remaining_bytes),\n
 *      int HandleReceivedExplictUDPData(socket_platform_t socket_handle, struct sockaddr_in
 * *from_address, EIP_UINT8* buffer, unsigned int buffer_length, int
 * *number_of_remaining_bytes).\n
 *     Depending if the data has been received from a TCP or from a UDP socket.
 *     As a result of this function a response may have to be sent. The data to
 *     be sent is in the given buffer pa_buf.
 *   - Create UDP sending and receiving sockets for implicit connected
 * messages\n
 *     OpENer will use to call-back function socket_platform_t CreateUdpSocket(
 *     UdpCommuncationDirection connection_direction,
 *     struct sockaddr_in *pa_pstAddr)
 *     for informing the platform specific code that a new connection is
 *     established and new sockets are necessary
 *   - Receive implicit connected data on a receiving UDP socket\n
 *     The received data has to be hand over to the Connection Manager Object
 *     with the function EIP_STATUS HandleReceivedConnectedData(EIP_UINT8
 * *data, int data_length)
 *   - Close UDP and TCP sockets:
 *      -# Requested by OpENer through the call back function: void
 * CloseSocket(socket_platform_t socket_handle)
 *      -# For TCP connection when the peer closed the connection OpENer needs
 *         to be informed to clean up internal data structures. This is done
 * with
 *         the function void CloseSession(socket_platform_t socket_handle).
 *      .
 *   - Cyclically update the connection status:\n
 *     In order that OpENer can determine when to produce new data on
 *     connections or that a connection timed out every @ref kOpenerTimerTickInMilliSeconds
 * milliseconds the
 *     function EIP_STATUS ManageConnections(void) has to be called.
 *
 * @section callback_funcs_sec Callback Functions
 * In order to make OpENer more platform independent and in order to inform the
 * application on certain state changes and actions within the stack a set of
 * call-back functions is provided. These call-back functions are declared in
 * the file opener_api.h and have to be implemented by the application specific
 * code. An overview and explanation of OpENer's call-back API may be found in
 * the module @ref CIP_CALLBACK_API.
 *
 * @page extending Extending OpENer
 * OpENer provides an API for adding own CIP objects and instances with
 * specific services and attributes. Therefore OpENer can be easily adapted to
 * support different device profiles and specific CIP objects needed for your
 * device. The functions to be used are:
 *   - CipClass *CreateCipClass( const CipUdint class_code,
                          const int number_of_class_attributes,
                          const EipUint32 highest_class_attribute_number,
                          const int number_of_class_services,
                          const int number_of_instance_attributes,
                          const EipUint32 highest_instance_attribute_number,
                          const int number_of_instance_services,
                          const int number_of_instances,
                          char *name,
                          const EipUint16 revision,
                          InitializeCipClass initializer );
 *   - CipInstance *AddCipInstances(CipClass *RESTRICT const cip_class,
                             const int number_of_instances)
 *   - CipInstance *AddCipInstance(CipClass *RESTRICT const class,
                            const EipUint32 instance_id)
 *   - void InsertAttribute(CipInstance *const cip_instance,
                     const EipUint16 attribute_number,
                     const EipUint8 cip_data_type,
                     void *const cip_data,
                     const EipByte cip_flags);
 *   - void InsertService(const CipClass *const cip_class_to_add_service,
                   const EipUint8 service_code,
                   const CipServiceFunction service_function,
                   char *const service_name);
