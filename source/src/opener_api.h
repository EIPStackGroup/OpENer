 * \section install_sec Building
 * How to compile, install and run OpENer on a specific platform.
 * \subsection build_req_sec Requirements
 * OpENer has been developed to be highly portable. The default version targets PCs
 * with a POSIX operating system and a BSD-socket network interface. To test this
 * version we recommend a Linux PC or Windows with Cygwin (www.cygwin.com)
 * installed. You will need to have the following installed:
 *   - gcc, make, binutils, etc.
 * 
 * for normal building. These should be installed on most Linux installations and
 * are part of the development packages of cygwin.
 * 
 * For the development itself we recommend the use of Eclipse with the CTD plugin
 * (www.eclipse.org). For your convenience OpENer already comes with an Eclipse
 * project file. This allows to just import the OpENer source tree into Eclipse.
 * 
 * \subsection compile_pcs_sec Compile for PCs
 *   -# Directly in the shell
 *       -# Go into the bin/pc directory
 *       -# Invoke make
 *       -# For invoking opener type:\n
 *          ./opener ipaddress subnetmask gateway domainname hostaddress macaddress\n
 *          e.g., ./opener 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 test.com testdevice 00 15 C5 BF D0 87 
 *   -# Within Eclipse
 *       -# Import the project
 *       -# Go to the bin/pc folder in the make targets view
 *       -# Choose all from the make targets
 *       -# The resulting executable will be in the directory
 *           ./bin/pc
 *       -# The command line parameters can be set in the run configuration dialog of Eclipse

 * The general stack properties have to be defined prior to building your 
 * production. This is done by providing a file called opener_user_conf.h. An 
 * example file can be found in the src/ports/platform-pc directory. The 
 * documentation of the example file for the necessary configuration options: 
 * opener_user_conf.h
 * 
 * \copydoc opener_user_conf.h
 * 
 * \section startup_sec Startup Sequence
 * During startup of your EtherNet/IP(TM) device the following steps have to be 
 * performed:
 *   -# Configure the network properties:\n
 *       With the following functions the network interface of OpENer is 
 *       configured:
 *        - EIP_STATUS configureNetworkInterface(const char *pa_acIpAdress, const char *pa_acSubNetMask, const char *pa_acGateway)
 *        - void configureMACAddress(const EIP_UINT8 *pa_acMACAddress)
 *        - void configureDomainName(const char *pa_acDomainName)
 *        - void configureHostName(const char *pa_acHostName)
 *        .
 *       Depending on your platform these data can come from a configuration 
 *       file or from operating system functions. If these values should be 
 *       setable remotely via explicit messages the SetAttributeSingle functions
 *       of the EtherNetLink and the TCPIPInterface object have to be adapted.
 *   -# Set the device's serial number\n
 *      According to the CIP specification a device vendor has to ensure that
 *      each of its devices has a unique 32Bit device id. You can set it with
 *      the function:
 *       - void setDeviceSerialNumber(EIP_UINT32 pa_nSerialNumber)
 *   -# Initialize OpENer: \n
 *      With the function CIP_Init(EIP_UINT16 pa_nUniqueConnID) the internal data structures of opener are
 *      correctly setup. After this step own CIP objects and Assembly objects 
 *      instances may be created. For your convenience we provide the call-back 
 *      function IApp_Init(void). This call back function is called when the stack is
 *      ready to receive application specific CIP objects.
 *   -# Create Application Specific CIP Objects:\n
 *      Within the call-back function IApp_Init(void) or after CIP_Init(void) 
 *      has finished you may create and configure any CIP object or Assembly object instances. See 
 *      the module \ref CIP_API for available functions. Currently no functions 
 *      are available to remove any created objects or instances. This is planned
 *      for future versions.
 *   -# Setup the listening TCP and UDP port:\n
 *      THE ETHERNET/IP SPECIFICATION demands from devices to listen to TCP 
 *      connections and UDP datagrams on the port AF12hex for explicit messages.
 *      Therefore before going into normal operation you need to configure your 
 *      network library so that TCP and UDP messages on this port will be 
 *      received and can be hand over to the Ethernet encapsulation layer.
 * 
 * \section normal_op_sec Normal Operation
 * During normal operation the following tasks have to be done by the platform
 * specific code:
 *   - Establish connections requested on TCP port AF12hex
 *   - Receive explicit message data on connected TCP sockets and the UPD socket
 *     for port AF12hex. The received data has to be hand over to Ethernet
 *     encapsulation layer with the functions: \n
 *      int handleReceivedExplictTCPData(int pa_socket, EIP_UINT8* pa_buf, int pa_length, int *pa_nRemainingBytes),\n
 *      int handleReceivedExplictUDPData(int pa_socket, struct sockaddr_in *pa_pstFromAddr, EIP_UINT8* pa_buf, unsigned int pa_length, int *pa_nRemainingBytes).\n
 *     Depending if the data has been received from a TCP or from a UDP socket.
 *     As a result of this function a response may have to be sent. The data to
 *     be sent is in the given buffer pa_buf.
 *   - Create UDP sending and receiving sockets for implicit connected messages\n
 *     OpENer will use to call-back function int IApp_CreateUDPSocket(int pa_nDirection, struct sockaddr_in *pa_pstAddr)
 *     for informing the platform specific code that a new connection is 
 *     established and new sockets are necessary
 *   - Receive implicit connected data on a receiving UDP socket\n
 *     The received data has to be hand over to the Connection Manager Object 
 *     with the function EIP_STATUS handleReceivedConnectedData(EIP_UINT8 *pa_pnData, int pa_nDataLength)
 *   - Close UDP and TCP sockets:
 *      -# Requested by OpENer through the call back function: void IApp_CloseSocket(int pa_nSockFd)
 *      -# For TCP connection when the peer closed the connection OpENer needs 
 *         to be informed to clean up internal data structures. This is done with
 *         the function void closeSession(int pa_nSocket).
 *      .
 *   - Cyclically update the connection status:\n
 *     In order that OpENer can determine when to produce new data on 
 *     connections or that a connection timed out every \ref OPENER_TIMER_TICK ms the 
 *     function EIP_STATUS manageConnections(void) has to be called.
 * 
 * \section callback_funcs_sec Callback Functions
 * In order to make OpENer more platform independent and in order to inform the 
 * application on certain state changes and actions within the stack a set of 
 * call-back functions is provided. These call-back functions are declared in 
 * the file opener_api.h and have to be implemented by the application specific 
 * code. An overview and explanation of OpENer's call-back API may be found in 
 * the module \ref CIP_CALLBACK_API.
 *  
 * \page extending Extending OpENer
 * OpENer provides an API for adding own CIP objects and instances with
 * specific services and attributes. Therefore OpENer can be easily adapted to
 * support different device profiles and specific CIP objects needed for your
 * device. The functions to be used are:
 *   - S_CIP_Class * createCIPClass(EIP_UINT32 pa_nClassID, int pa_nNr_of_ClassAttributes, EIP_UINT32 pa_nClassGetAttrAllMask, int pa_nNr_of_ClassServices, int pa_nNr_of_InstanceAttributes, EIP_UINT32 pa_nInstGetAttrAllMask, int pa_nNr_of_InstanceServices, int pa_nNr_of_Instances, char *pa_acName, EIP_UINT16 pa_nRevision);
 *   - S_CIP_Instance * addCIPInstances(S_CIP_Class *pa_pstCIPObject, int pa_nNr_of_Instances);
 *   - S_CIP_Instance * addCIPInstance(S_CIP_Class * pa_pstCIPClass, EIP_UINT32 pa_nInstanceId);
 *   - void insertAttribute(S_CIP_Instance *pa_pInstance, EIP_UINT16 pa_nAttributeNr, EIP_UINT8 pa_nCIP_Type, void* pa_pt2data);
 *   - void insertService(S_CIP_Class *pa_pClass, EIP_UINT8 pa_nServiceNr, TCIPServiceFunc pa_ptfuncService, char *name);
